**Overview**

This repository showcases my skills in GPU programming using CUDA, image processing with OpenCV, and utilizing the cuFFT library for fast Fourier transforms. The project focuses on implementing a Gaussian blur algorithm on images, demonstrating the power of parallel computing and optimization techniques, including shared memory. Gaussian blur is a fundamental image processing technique used for smoothing and reducing noise in images. 

**Technologies Used**

 _CUDA:_ The parallel computing platform and API from NVIDIA for GPU acceleration.
    
_OpenCV:_ An open-source computer vision library for image input/output and various image processing tasks.
    
_cuFFT (CUDA Fast Fourier Transform):_ NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated library for performing fast Fourier transforms.
